CHAPTER-1 Static Array (Custom Implementation in Java)

🚀 A lightweight custom array implementation in Java to understand how arrays work internally.
This project covers manual array operations like insert, append, edit, delete, and edge case handling — without using Java Collections.

📌 Features
• Create a fixed-size array
• Append data to the end
• Insert data at any position (with shifting)
• Edit values at specific index
• Delete data (with shifting)
• Check if array is full or empty
• Get total elements & capacity
• Edge case handling with clear error messages

🛠️ Tech Stack
• Language: Java (Core Java)
• Concepts: Static Arrays, Index Handling, Manual Shifting

✅ Learning Goals
• Understand internal working of arrays in Java
• Practice index validation & shifting logic
• Explore limitations of static arrays(FIX SIZE) before moving to ArrayList or dynamic structures
